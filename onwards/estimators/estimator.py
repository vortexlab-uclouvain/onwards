        Prototype class for user defined Estimator objects. 
        Estimator converts th Turbine's measurements, m_wt, to the Turbine's
        state, s_wt.

        .. math::
            \mathbf{m}_{wt} \rightarrow \mathbf{\hat{s}}_{wt} 

        The ith state, s_wt^i, is computed from the sensors measurements possibly
        along with previously computed states, s_wt^J, with J : j < i

        .. math::
            \mathbf{\hat{s}}_{wt}^i
                = \mathbf{\hat{s}}_{wt}^i(\mathbf{m}_{wt}, \mathbf{\hat{s}}_{wt}^J)

        ----------
        wt : Turbine
            Parent :class:`.Turbine` object.
        meas : list
            List of the measurements meas required by the Estimator.
        states : list
            List of the Turbine's states computed by the Estimator.
        req_state : list
            List of the Turbine's states required by the Estimator.
        avail_states : list

            If the requested Turbine's state is not (yet) available.
